Star Wars!!!

The goal of this game is to choose an attacking character, and to vanquish the remaining characters one at a time.  If you defeat the rest of the characters, you win!  If you run out of health points, you lose! 

you can click through the instructions if you want.  once you pick a character, they disappear. 

Game Play is initiated by clicking on one of the characters to chose an attacking character.  Following this action, you click a second character, which will be the first defending character.  This sets the stage for the battle. 

Once the stage is set, you click the button "attack" which brings out a droid that shoots lasers!!! This will remove health points from the defending character, and initiate a counter-attack from the defending character that will remove your health points.  This play is continued until one of you runs out of health points.  If it is the defending character, you pick another defending character and play resumes until you lose, or you win.

do not click attack too fast! there is a bug that can cause the win screen to populate if you click immediately.  wait a second for the droid to do its thing! 

Each character has a set amount of health points, and each defender has a set amount of attack points.  The attacking character's attack points increases throughout the game by an amount called "attack power" after each attack. 

Each character can win this game, but, you must carefully chose your strategy for picking each defending player in order to win. 

if you want to start over, click the "reset" button and play is reset. 

Enjoy!
